## Description
This is the second part of a two-group work devoted to the creation of the simulation of a positron-induced muon source. The first part of this project, which was destinated to the generation of the physical events can be found [**here**](https://github.com/vanessacerrone/LEMMA_project/blob/main/Project_group20.ipynb). In this [**second part**](https://github.com/javivilladamigo/ProjectLEMMA_part2/blob/master/Project.ipynb), the dataset is analyzed and an experimental setup is designed in order to simulate the data processing of the real experiment. This setup and analysis are largely based on the 2021 proposal for project LEMMA. In this work, experimental resolutions, hard-scattering corrections and recovery of the initial momenta of the muons have been assessed.
